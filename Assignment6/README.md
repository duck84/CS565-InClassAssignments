My-app is the tic-tac-toe tutorial. To run npm start.

express-locallibrary-tutorial is the node express tutorial. To run npm start.

I also did the TypeScript lab which is in the CodeLab folder. I am sure how to run it since I did it on the online editor.

I also did the Google lab, but there was an error with the version. Catrina gave me an alternative lab for Google, but that did not involve writing code. It was setting up a node server with Google Cloud.
